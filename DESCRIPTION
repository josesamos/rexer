Description: The main purpose of this package is to streamline the
    generation of exams that include random elements in exercises.
    Exercises can be defined in a table, based on text and figures, and
    may contain gaps to be filled with provided options. Exam documents
    can be generated in various formats. It allows us to generate a
    version for conducting the assessment and another version that
    facilitates correction, linked through a code.
