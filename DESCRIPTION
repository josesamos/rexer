Description: The main objective of this package is to facilitate the 
    generation of exams incorporating random elements to exercises. This 
    applies to both the exercises featured in the exam and the components 
    defined within each exercise, all of which can be randomized. Documents 
    can be generated in PDF, HTML, or Word format. It produces a version 
    for conducting the assessment and a version that facilitates the 
    correction, linked through a code.
